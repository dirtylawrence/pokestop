# pokestop

## Set your location to anywhere in the world.  

This project can be used to set your location on iOS.  

The original goal of this project was to let people with disabilities enjoy the wonderful game that is Pok√©mon Go - I feel that mobile games should be for everyone. 

This limited version here is so that anyone can set themselves in hard to reach pokestops. Use this instead of putting yourself into dangerous spots, please.

I'm also building a more advanced version of this - one that allows you to generate a path between pokestops to play along, pausing freely as you go. If you have a disability, please contact me directly for a barely working version.

There's an Android version coming in the next few days.

It would be super cool if you wanted to fund the effort.
